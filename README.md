# SimpleGame
This not-fun-at-all game was creaed for my Java course. And I registered my FIRST Github account recrntly:tada:, so I thought why not upload my game to Github. And here comes this repository.
The game's main code is located in core/src/com/mygdx/game/
## Featuring : 
  Random spawn 5 enemies and swords at the end of the level
  Funny bugs
BGM is from Super Meat Boy. Hopefully no one will sue me for this.
